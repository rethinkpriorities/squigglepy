## Squigglepy: Implementation of Squiggle in Python

[Squiggle] is a "simple programming language for intuitive probabilistic estimation". It serves as its own standalone programming language with its own syntax, but it is implemented in JavaScript. I like the features of Squiggle and intend to use it frequently, but I also sometimes want to use similar functionalities in Python, especially alongside other Python statistical programming packages like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The **squigglepy** package here implements many Squiggle-like functionalities in Python.
